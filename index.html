      <p class="job-seeking">
        I am seeking a Senior Technical Product Manager role where I can lead products that improve operational performance and workflow efficiency.
      </p>

      <p>
        I design and build digital systems that connect people, processes, and data across complex organizations. My products streamline work, increase visibility, and help teams deliver exceptional work at speed.
      </p>

      <p>
        My experience comes from more than twenty years inside global enterprises where processes, data, and tools often operate in silos. I understand how organizations think, how decisions are made, and how to align technology with the people and workflows it supports.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work across enterprise platforms such as ServiceNow, cloud environments, and modern data technologies to choose the right architecture, integrate systems, and deliver solutions that scale. I apply AI when it provides clear value and design products that work effectively without AI when needed.

      This portfolio demonstrates my experience delivering solutions in large-scale enterprise environments. It is divided into two sections to show both my past work and my forward-looking innovation:

      <strong>Projects</strong> – Real-world examples of enterprise projects I have led, modernized, or optimized. These highlight discovery, design, delivery, integration, change management, and long-term product evolution.
    </p>
